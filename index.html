      <p>
        The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments.<br >
        In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone.<br >
        Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin,
        that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the
        player's hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound.

      <p>
        Drums are usually played by striking with the hand, a beater attached to
        a pedal, or with one or two sticks with or without padding.<br >
        A wide variety of sticks are used, including wooden sticks and sticks
        with soft beaters of felt on the end.<br >
        In jazz, some drummers use brushes for a smoother, quieter sound.
